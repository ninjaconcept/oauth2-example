    # A fix for the stupid "A copy of ApplicationController has been removed from the module tree but is still active!"
    # error message that is caused in rails >= v2.3.3
    #
    # This error is caused because the application controller is unloaded but, the controllers in the plugin are still
    # referring to the super class that is unloaded!
    #
    # Uncommenting these lines fixes the issue, but makes the ApplicationController not reloadable in dev mode.
    #
